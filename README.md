KeeWee
======

KeeWee is a real-time speech synthesizer leveraged by Overtone and Clojure. 


Naming
======

The original name for KeeWee is MyoTalk, literally a speech synthesizer controlled by muscle activities. Coincidentally the Chinese transliteration of "MyoTalk" sounds very much like kiwi (猕猴桃). Formally if you apply the following transformations:
> (i-to-ee (voice-to-english-text (text-to-chinese-speech "MyoTalk")))
You'll get the interesting name "KeeWee".
